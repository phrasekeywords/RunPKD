Phrase-Keywords is a AI-powered web automation platform that revolutionizes how you create browser automation. Originally created in 2010 by Omari W. Dixon,  the platform has evolved from a traditional Selenium Java solution that you had to download from GitHub, to an AI-driven approach (requiring no download) that generates your entire automation framework from a single prompt.

Using our proven PKD (Phrase-Keywords Definition) spreadsheet format, you still define your automation steps step-by-step as always. The game-changer? A one-time AI prompt generates a complete Selenium solution that reads and executes your PKD flows automatically. Load it into your IDE, start the engine, and you're ready to create and run unlimited PKD flows—no manual Selenium coding required.
